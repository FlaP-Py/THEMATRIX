This WebApp was built by our team TheMatrix using Python/Django framework while participating in LNMIIT Hackathon (17/16/2016) in less than ten hours.
The App is basicly an open disscussion forum which hides your original identity and give you a new one.
This app provides you a complete fake id i.e. new name, gender, address and picture while registering using the RandomUser API.
