This WebApp was built by our team TheMatrix while participating in LNMIIT Hackathon (17/16/2016) in less than ten hours.
The App is basicly an open disscussion forum which hides your original identity and give you a new one.
This app provides you a complete fake id i.e. new name, gender, address and picture while registering.
Also it uses RandomUser API to generate fake id's.
