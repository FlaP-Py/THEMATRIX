This WebApp was built by our team TheMatrix using Python/Django framework while participating in LNMIIT Hackathon (17/4/2016) in less than ten hours. The App is basically an open disscussion forum which hides your original identity and gives you a new one on the forum. This app provides you a complete fake id i.e. new name, gender, address and picture while registering using the RandomUser API so that one can give unbiased opinions on the issues discussed.
